Project Name: minesweeper.py

Description:
This script defines a function to annotate a Minesweeper grid. Given a 2D list representing a Minesweeper board (where "#" indicates a mine and "-" indicates an empty cell), the code replaces each empty cell with the count of mines in its adjacent cells.
Mines are left unchanged. The script includes an example usage that prints the annotated board.
